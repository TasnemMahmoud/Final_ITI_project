News App - Flutter
Overview
The News App is a cross-platform mobile application built using Flutter and Dart, which allows users to stay up to date with the latest news articles. The app fetches articles from a public News API and displays them in a user-friendly interface. Users can view headlines, read full articles, and interact with the app by liking and saving their favorite news.

Features
Cross-platform Support: Runs on both Android and iOS with the same codebase.
API Integration: Fetches news articles in real-time from an external News API.
News Categories: Browse news from various categories like Technology, Sports, Business, etc.
Search Functionality: Search for specific news articles by keywords.
Interactive UI: Users can like, save, and comment on news articles.
Dark Mode: Supports light and dark themes for a better user experience.
State Management: Efficient state management using Provider or BLoC.
Local Data Storage: Store user preferences (like saved articles) using SharedPreferences.

Tech Stack
Flutter: Front-end framework to build cross-platform mobile applications.
Dart: Programming language used with Flutter.
NewsAPI: For fetching real-time news articles.
Provider / BLoC: For managing the app’s state.
SharedPreferences: To store small amounts of user data locally (e.g., saved articles, preferences).
Project Setup
Prerequisites
Flutter SDK installed (check Flutter installation guide).
Dart SDK (comes with Flutter).
Android Studio or VS Code for development.
NewsAPI Key (get it from NewsAPI).

Installation Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-app-flutter.git
cd news-app-flutter
Install dependencies:

Run the following command to install all necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
flutter pub get
Configure API key:

App Structure
lib/
main.dart: Entry point of the application.
models/: Contains data models like Article.
services/: Contains API service for fetching news data.
screens/: Contains all the UI screens like HomeScreen, ArticleDetailScreen.
widgets/: Contains reusable UI components such as NewsCard, SearchBar.
providers/: Manages app-wide state using Provider/BLoC.
API Integration
The app fetches news data from NewsAPI using HTTP requests. For instance, here's an example of how the app fetches the top headlines:

dart
Copy code
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<List<Article>> fetchTopHeadlines() async {
  final response = await http.get(
    Uri.parse('https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY'),
  );

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    return parseArticles(response.body);
  } else {
    throw Exception('Failed to load news');
  }
}
State Management
The app uses Provider or BLoC for state management, ensuring efficient and organized handling of app-wide state changes.

Example using Provider:

dart
Copy code
class NewsProvider with ChangeNotifier {
  List<Article> _articles = [];

  List<Article> get articles => _articles;

  Future<void> fetchArticles() async {
    _articles = await NewsApiService.getArticles();
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
Local Storage
User preferences such as saved articles are stored using SharedPreferences. Here’s how you can save and retrieve user data:

Save article:

dart
Copy code
Future<void> saveArticle(Article article) async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  prefs.setString('saved_article_${article.id}', jsonEncode(article.toJson()));
}
Retrieve saved articles:

dart
Copy code
Future<List<Article>> getSavedArticles() async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  // Logic to retrieve saved articles from SharedPreferences
}
